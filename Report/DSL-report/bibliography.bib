abstract = {Sentiment Analysis (SA) is an ongoing field of research in text mining field. SA is the computational treatment of opinions, sentiments and subjectivity of text. This survey paper tackles a comprehensive overview of the last update in this field. Many recently proposed algorithms' enhancements and various SA applications are investigated and presented briefly in this survey. These articles are categorized according to their contributions in the various SA techniques. The related fields to SA (transfer learning, emotion detection, and building resources) that attracted researchers recently are discussed. The main target of this survey is to give nearly full image of SA techniques and the related fields with brief details. The main contributions of this paper include the sophisticated categorizations of a large number of recent articles and the illustration of the recent trend of research in the sentiment analysis and its related areas.}

abstract = {In this paper, with regards to aspect-based sentiment classification accuracy problem, we propose a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) feature selection method that can determine the most relevant set of features for aspect-based sentiment classification. Feature selection helps to reduce redundant features and remove irrelevant features which affect classifier accuracy. In this paper we present a method for feature selection for twitter aspect-based sentiment classification based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is combined with Sentiwordnet lexicon-based method which is incorporated with Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning framework to perform the classification. Experiments on our own Hate Crime Twitter Sentiment (HCTS) and benchmark Stanford Twitter Sentiment (STS) datasets yields accuracies of 94.53 % and 97.93 % respectively. The comparisons with other statistical feature selection methods shows that our proposed approach shows promising results in improving aspect-based sentiment classification performance.},

abstract={Purpose The automatic removal of suffixes from words in English is of particular interest in the field of information retrieval. This work was originally published in Program in 1980 and is republished as part of a series of articles commemorating the 40th anniversary of the journal. Design/methodology/approach An algorithm for suffix stripping is described, which has been implemented as a short, fast program in BCPL. Findings Although simple, it performs slightly better than a much more elaborate system with which it has been compared. It effectively works by treating complex suffixes as compounds made up of simple suffixes, and removing the simple suffixes in a number of steps. In each step the removal of the suffix is made to depend upon the form of the remaining stem, which usually involves a measure of its syllable length. Originality/value The piece provides a useful historical document on information retrieval.},
